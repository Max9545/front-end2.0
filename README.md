## Overview:

_Selector_ is a web application that seamlessly connects your Discogs vinyl purchasing experience with the convenient streaming capabilities of Spotify. Users can discover, browse, save, and sample their (soon-to-be) favorite music. This __Cypress-tested__, multi-page user-interface was built using __React__, __React Router__, __JavaScript__, __HTML__, __CSS__, and __ApolloClient__; integrated using __Travis CI__ and depolyed on __Heroku__.

## Learning Goals
+ Demonstrate knowledge youâ€™ve gained throughout Turing
+ Use an agile process to turn well defined requirements into deployed and production ready software
+ Gain experience dividing applications into components and domains of responsibilities to facilitate multi-developer teams. Service oriented architecture concepts and patterns are highly encouraged.
+ Explore and implement new concepts, patterns, or libraries that have not been explicitly taught while at Turing
+ Practice an advanced, professional git workflow using Git Rebase
+ Gain experience using continuous integration tools to build and automate the deployment of features
+ Build applications that execute in development, test, CI, and production environments
+ Focus on communication between front-end and back-end teams in order to complete and deploy features that have been outlined by the project spec

## Features


#### Application Demo

![demo-vid](public/AlluresDemoSelector.gif)



---
## Challenges
+ Familiarizing ourselves with the relationship between GraphQL and ApolloClient
+ Continous-Integration with Travis CI
+ Adapting to the Git Rebase workflow
+ State and UI synchronization with regards to the application's favoriting feature
+ Disrupted flow of work caused by network request limitations from the source Discogs API
+ Album objects without unique title matches yields unexpected results

---
## Wins
+ Successfully submitting requests to ApolloClient
+ Overcoming failing Travis CI builds


---
## Future Iterations
+ A user can add favorite albums to a non-local database. 
+ A user can display all of their favorite albums in alignment with the non-local database.  
+ Utilizing the non-local database to keep GSM throughout the cache
+ Additional media types to consume music (YouTube, Shazam, SoundCloud, a ticket selling API for live concerts)
