# Selector Back End

This is the backend engine Selector, a web application that connects users with Spotify and Discogs, for a seamless, music browsing (and eventually "purchasing") experience. The application is built with service oriented architecture. The backend communicates with the frontend using our choice of "stretch technology" for this project, as a single GraphQL endpoint, which supplies data from multiple other endpoints the Back End is interacting with. The database currently stores "Favorites", but there are plans for much more, starting with users.

## Overview

This project is definitely not Rotten Tomatoes. Nor is it Netflix. Nor is it IMDB. Itâ€™s R A N C I D T O M A T I L L O S. Very different!

_Rancid Tomatillos_ is a [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.io/) Module 3 paired project. The purpose of this project is to create a dynamic application that leverages an API to receive, and display, movie data. A user can search and filter a long list of movies, as well as view detailed information about a specific movie by clicking on it. To create this application, we leveraged React, React Router, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create the front-end. As we worked, we used Cypress for test-driven development of our application.




## Planning Resources

* [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/JeffShepherd/Rancid-Tomatillos/projects/1)
* ![wireframe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70557704/119737153-0e2bd180-be3c-11eb-96a4-a3689cf88368.png)


## Setup Instructions


Clone down this repository to your local machine:

```

```

Then install the library dependencies by running:

```
npm install
```

To start application, run:

```
npm start
```

If you see `Compiled successfully!` in your terminal, the application is running and the app can be veiwed at `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.



## Learning Goals

* Gain competency with React fundamentals
* Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JavaScript
* Practice refactoring
* Create a multi-page UX using Router
